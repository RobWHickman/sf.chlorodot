# sf.chlorodot
Simple Dot Chloropleth Maps using sf


A packaged version of Paul Campbell's blogpost at https://www.cultureofinsight.com/blog/2018/05/02/2018-04-08-multivariate-dot-density-maps-in-r-with-sf-ggplot2/.
Hopefully should allow for faster generation of dot chloropleth maps for people wanting to emulate the post. Also contains the data from the blogpost as an example.

```{r}
library(sf)
library(sf.chlorodot)

ge_data <- sf.chlordot::
```
